Summary
----------------------------------------------------
![Kactus2 logo](common/graphics/appicon.png)

Kactus2 is a toolset for designing embedded products, especially FPGA-based
MP-SoCs. The aim is easier IP reusability and integration for both hardware and
software. The tool is based on IEEE 1685-2014 "IP-XACT" standard.

Windows installer and tar-package for Linux are available in 
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kactus2/)

Guidelines for issue reporting and contributing are given in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Other support is provided by email: kactus2@cs.tut.fi

What you can do with Kactus2
----------------------------------------------------
Package IPs for reuse and exchange
 * Import your existing IPs as IP-XACT components
 * Create new IP-XACT components and generate their HDL module headers
 * Reuse IP-XACT files from any standard compatible vendor
 * Reuse the IPs in your designs and connect them with wires and busses

Create HW designs with hierarchy
 * Create multilevel hierarchies, where a design has multiple sub-designs
 * Configure component instances in designs, including the sub-designs
 * Use generator plugins to create HDL with wiring and parameterization

Integrate HW and SW
 * Use memory designer to preview memory maps and address spaces in your hierarchy
 * Package software to IP-XACT components and map them to hardware
 * Generate makefiles that build executables with rules defined in IP-XACT components
 
What you cannot do with Kactus2
----------------------------------------------------
 * Behavioral logic: Neither Kactus2 nor IP-XACT handles module implementations
 * Synthesis or simulation: These require tools that are specificly created for the purpose
 
Examples and tutorials
----------------------------------------------------
Example IPs are available in GitHub [here](https://github.com/kactus2/ipxactexamplelib).

Video tutorials are available in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kactus2Tutorial).

Windows install
----------------------------------------------------
An installer (link above) will guide you through the installation on Windows platforms.

If you want to build Kactus2 on Windows, see separate instructions in our project 
management site: https://kactus2.cs.tut.fi

Linux build and run
----------------------------------------------------

#### 1. Install Qt5

To build and run Kactus2, Qt5 must be installed on your system. If you already have Qt installed,
you can skip to step 2. Otherwise, select installing Qt with either using a package manager
(option a) or manually (option b):

a) Install Qt5 packages using a package manager (requires admin privileges).
The following packages are required (on Ubuntu):

  * qt5-default
  * qttools5-private-dev
  * qttools5-dev-tools
  * libqt5svg5-dev

Example:
```
sudo apt-get install qt5-default qttools5-private-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev
```

b) Manually download and install from https://www.qt.io/download/

When using manually installed Qt5, you need to make sure that Kactus2 install is configured accordingly:
Open the file configure in the Kactus2 root directory and set the path to Qt5 binaries in the 
variable QTBIN_PATH. 
  
Example: 
      
    QTBIN_PATH="~/Qt/5.7/gcc_64/bin/"
  
Please do note the slash at the end of the path. 

#### 2. Build the sources

First, get the Kactus2 source files. We recommend using the release tar-package (link above)
which has all Windows-specific files removed. Extract the files and navigate to the 
Kactus2 root directory. 

Example:
```
mkdir ~/kactus2
tar -xvf kactus2-3.4.0.tar.gz -C ~/kactus2
cd ~/kactus2
```

Select installation either for all users (option a) or customized target (option b) below:

a) Default installation for all users (requires admin privileges).

Open file .qmake.conf and check that the paths are compatible with your Linux distribution.
The defaults should work with Ubuntu 64-bit, Debian and CentOS 7 64-bit, but on some systems
you may have to change lib_path from /usr/lib to /usr/lib64.

Now run following commands:
```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

After the installation, skip to section 3. 

b) Customized installation target. This option can be used for a local installation for the 
current user (e.g. in ~/kactus2) as well as shared installation in a specific directory 
(e.g. /opt/edatools/kactus2).

Open file .qmake.conf and set the installation directory in variable LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR.
  
Example:
  
    LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR="~/kactus2"
  
By default, the shared libraries are installed in the same directory, but can be configured
by setting the lib_path on line 44.
  
Now run the following commands:
```
./configure
make
make install
```

Run `sudo make install`, if the current user has no write permissions to the target directory 
(e.g. /opt/edatools/kactus2).

Finally, make sure the shared libraries can be found by the program loader. If the installation
is shared between multiple users, consider listing the libraries in /etc/ld.so.conf. For example,
create the file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/kactus2-3.4.0.conf and in it add a single line that contains the
path to the installation directory (e.g. /opt/edatools/kactus2). Run `ldconfig` to update the paths
in the loader.

Please note, if you do ./configure with wrong Qt binaries, you will have to delete the generated 
makefiles before configuring again. The easiest way to do this, is to run command `make distclean`.

#### 3a. Run Kactus2 GUI

There are three ways to run Kactus2 depending on your system and installation setup.

a) A default installation shared between users. Run:
  
    /usr/bin/kactus2

b) A local installation from the installation directory. Run:
    
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./kactus2

If the library paths are set in /etc/ld.so.conf, the binary can be run directly.
Example:

	/opt/edatools/kactus2
	
c) In some systems, a link to the executable is created, if Kactus2 was installed for all users. Run:

    kactus2

Please note a recent change to lower-case binary name i.e. kactus2, not Kactus2.

#### 3b. Run Kactus2 command-line (experimental)

Some tasks may be run in the command-line without the GUI. Currently only Verilog and VHDL 
generators supports this feature and can be executed with command `generate_verilog` and
`generate_vhdl`. Additional options are required as detailed below.

Example:

    kactus2 generate_verilog -c tut.fi:cpu.logic:alu:1.0 -w structural_verilog -o ./rtl_out
    
This will generate structural Verilog for the `-c` component `tut.fi:cpu.logic:alu:1.0` and 
its sub-component hierarchy defined in `-w` view `structural_verilog` into `-o` directory `./rtl_out`.

Kactus2 supports the following general command-line options:
* `-h, --help`: Show the application usage help and exit.
* `-v, --version`: Show the application version and exit.

Please note that the command-line interface is an experimental feature and very likely 
subject to changes in the near future. 

Settings and configurations
----------------------------------------------------

Kactus2 uses a settings file for storing user-specific tool settings. The file default location
is ~/.config/TUT/Kactus2.ini in Linux and C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\TUT\Kactus2.ini
in Windows. The location can be checked on the general settings page in Kactus2.

A system wide default settings file is located in /etc/xdg and C:\ProgramData, respectively.
This will be used as a base for any new user-specific settings and a fallback mechanism, if
the user's file is missing a requested value.

Modifying the settings files manually is not recommended and should be done only by advanced 
users. Most of the time all required changes can be applied in the Kactus2 GUI.

In addition, Kactus2 uses the file configure.cfg for updating the users' settings when
new setting options are introduced in the tool. Please do not modify this file as it will
break the compatibility with earlier versions.

POSH Simulation
----------------------------------------------------
### Building Kactus2 
Please follow the instructions above on the section "1. Install Qt5", "2. Build the sources" and "3a. Run Kactus2 GUI".

### Adding The POSH IP Library 
1. Please locate the folder/directory where you installed libsystemctlm-soc
2. From the top menu ribbon locate the "Library" section and click on the Configure Library menu item. 
3. With the Configure Library dialog open, click on the (+) icon on the right hand side and from the File Dialog select the location of the folder from Step 1. Ensure you set it as the default and active before clicking the ok button.
4.  Done, you should be able to see your library of IPs located on the left hand side of the window under the VLNV Tree. 

### Running The Simulation
1. From the VLNV Tree, expand the xilinx.com collection and the traverse it all the way down to the desing you would like to simulate.
2. Select the design you want to simulate, right click and from the context menu select "Open HW Design" 
3. The selected design hardware view will open in the main pane.
4. From the main menu ribbon scroll all the way to the right of the ribbon(some times this is hidden depending on the size/resolution of your display) and locate the section POSH. 
5. Select the icon with the little gears to configure the simulation parameters. 
6. Once you have verified the script name, arguments and script engine click on OK. 
7. Locate and click on the thunder bolt icon to launch the simulation 
8. The output window will provide you with a status of the build
